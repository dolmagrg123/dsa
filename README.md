## OBJECTIVES

### Core Game Mechanics
- **10 attempts** maximum per game session
- **Configurable difficulty levels** (Easy: 4 digits, Medium: 8 digits, Difficult: custom length)
- **Dynamic digit range** based on difficulty (0-7 for easy/medium, 0-9 for difficult)

Game initializes and selects "0 1 3 5"
Player guesses "2 2 4 6" â†’ "All digits input are incorrect"
Player guesses "0 2 4 6" â†’ "1 correct number and 1 correct location"
Player guesses "2 2 1 1" â†’ "1 correct number and 0 correct location"
Player guesses "0 1 5 6" â†’ "3 correct numbers and 2 correct location"
```

### User Interface Features
